## HA Custom component for plant

This custom `plant` sensor is able to automaticly get the min/max levels for moisture, temperature, conductivity and brightness for a plant into a single UI element. You have only go to the openplantdatabase.io and search your the correct plantid for you plant. Beside that it works the same as the normal plant component.

Beside that you are still able to set the minimum and maximum values for each measurement. 

It will change its state to "problem" if it is not within those limits.
